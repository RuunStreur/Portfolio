Portfolio for Computational Musicology 2022

When thinking of a popular band or record, we mostly think about the charismatic lead singer, virtouous guitarist or energetic drummer. Overlooked however is often the role of the producer of the band. It is not without reason that George Martin is often called 'the fifth Beatle'. How much influance do producers have on a bands sound? How much does a record producers put their own style into the records they produce? Of course this will vary a lot from producer to producer, but for this Portfolio the work of one producer in particular will be highlighted: Brian Eno. Eno is regarded as one of the best producers in the history of record producers and has produced for names as Talking Heads, Roxy Music and U2. With fellow producer Tony Visconte he helped David Bowie create his famed 'Berlin Trilogy', existing of 'Low', 'Heroes' and 'Lodger', which this Portfolio will analyse and investigate. Next to Bowie's Berlin Trilogy we will look at another trilogy Eno has produced: Talking Heads's 'More songs about buildings and food', 'Fear of Music' and 'Remain in Light'.
Can we find notable differences within Eno and non-Eno produced records? Are there correlations between his work with Bowie and Talking Heads?
