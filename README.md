Portfolio for Computational Musicology 2022

When thinking of a popular band or record, we mostly think about the charismatic lead singer, virtouous guitarist or energetic drummer. Overlooked however is often the role of the producer of the band. It is not without reason that George Martin is often called 'the fifth Beatle'. How much influance do producers have on a bands sound? How much does a record producers put their own style into the records they produce? Of course this will vary a lot from producer to producer, but for this Portfolio the work of one producer in particular will be highlighted: Rick Rubin. Rubin has produced over 200 records in the past 30 years, for bands such as The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Slayer, Johnny Cash and Shakira to name a few. By just looking at the given examples it is clear that Rubin has worked on various projects with a wide range of genres and musical styles. This makes Rubin a very interesting case to examine, since we can compare his influence on different bands. Can we find similarities in albums produced by Rubin across bands and genres? 

If Rick Rubin's discography is found to be too large, I could investigate the influence of producer Brian Eno on David Bowie's 'Berlin Trilogy' ('Low', 'Heroes' and 'Lodger' were produced by Eno). This can be easily set against his work without Eno.

Corpus Rubin
Red Hot Chili Peppers, first and last album weren't produced by rubin
Johnny Cash, The american series versus his other work
Metallica 2008 death magnetixc, 2011 beyond magnetic versus their other work

Corpus Eno
David Bowie 'Berlin Trilogy' versus Bowie's other work.
